00:01:11,107 --> 00:01:13,018
Yagmur!

2
00:01:13,747 --> 00:01:15,339
Yagmur, stop!

3
00:01:40,707 --> 00:01:42,140
Water and Fire

4
00:01:42,307 --> 00:01:44,457
''There is no such thing
as coincidence.

5
00:01:44,627 --> 00:01:46,663
lf it's meant to happen,
it happens.

6
00:01:47,827 --> 00:01:51,376
All of this was meant to happen,
and it did.

7
00:01:51,547 --> 00:01:53,458
Fire met water.

8
00:01:53,627 --> 00:01:57,461
But neitherthe waterevaporated,
northe fire went out.

9
00:01:57,627 --> 00:01:59,902
The flames
swallowed the entire city.

10
00:02:00,547 --> 00:02:04,745
All they felt was pain.
And what a pain...''

11
00:02:04,947 --> 00:02:07,507
Honey,
l loved the book's cover.

12
00:02:08,907 --> 00:02:10,545
l'm so excited!

13
00:02:10,667 --> 00:02:12,942
You are the first
to officially read the book.

14
00:02:13,147 --> 00:02:15,138
Call me when you finish it.

15
00:02:15,307 --> 00:02:16,262
l know.

16
00:02:16,387 --> 00:02:18,901
l promise, l'll finish it by evening,
l'll call you then.

17
00:02:19,067 --> 00:02:20,386
l love you, honey.

18
00:02:20,547 --> 00:02:22,344
l love you too.

19
00:02:26,747 --> 00:02:29,261
''Theirfirst time meeting
had been painful.

20
00:02:30,027 --> 00:02:33,576
The man was already scarred but
did not show it.

21
00:02:35,587 --> 00:02:40,741
The beads of sweat on his face were
the only sign of the pain inside.''

22
00:02:53,627 --> 00:02:56,824
-Are you okay, brother?.
-l'm fine, l'm fine.

23
00:02:56,987 --> 00:03:00,297
-lf you need anything, let me know.
-Alright.

24
00:03:45,027 --> 00:03:46,380
God damn it.

25
00:03:46,547 --> 00:03:50,381
How many times do l have to say
that l don't want a window seat?

26
00:04:30,507 --> 00:04:34,056
l'm so sorry.
Sorry. Excuse me...

27
00:04:34,267 --> 00:04:38,579
l have a fear of flying,
l wasn't even aware. Well...

28
00:04:42,147 --> 00:04:43,182
Let me see that.

29
00:04:44,027 --> 00:04:46,746
l clawed you very badly,
l'm so sorry.

30
00:04:46,947 --> 00:04:48,824
This is why l don't like to fly.

31
00:04:48,947 --> 00:04:52,906
l know that the fearis unfounded,
but l'm still scared.

32
00:05:02,107 --> 00:05:03,779
l'm so sorry.

33
00:05:46,987 --> 00:05:51,981
Brother, this is a safe place.
Necmi's place is very close to here.

34
00:05:52,147 --> 00:05:54,103
You didn't do anything wrong,
brother.

35
00:05:54,227 --> 00:05:57,503
You didn't run.
You did the right thing.

36
00:05:57,667 --> 00:06:00,818
You are not to blame
in what has happened.

37
00:06:02,387 --> 00:06:05,584
These places are yours,
you've probably missed it.

38
00:06:05,707 --> 00:06:08,426
Do not leave my side, okay?

39
00:06:12,027 --> 00:06:13,540
Go on.

40
00:06:13,947 --> 00:06:17,178
Help with the luggage, come on.
-Alright, brother.

41
00:06:21,627 --> 00:06:22,696
Hasmet!

42
00:06:53,187 --> 00:06:54,745
l'm starving,
when will you be done?

43
00:06:54,907 --> 00:06:57,705
-l'll be down in half an hour.
-Alright.

44
00:06:59,067 --> 00:07:00,500
Hey, Nick!

45
00:07:09,987 --> 00:07:12,455
There's no problem, sir,
and we are at Necmi's place now.

46
00:07:12,667 --> 00:07:13,622
How's he doing?

47
00:07:13,747 --> 00:07:14,736
Good.

48
00:07:14,907 --> 00:07:16,943
Don't let him do anything crazy,
like coming back here.

49
00:07:17,227 --> 00:07:21,903
You are in control there, Turhan.
l'm going to be gone for a while.

50
00:07:22,067 --> 00:07:24,627
The issue has gone to the police
in a different light. Not good.

51
00:07:24,787 --> 00:07:27,904
Alright, sir. Don't worry,
everything is fine here.

52
00:07:37,307 --> 00:07:38,899
Okay then.

53
00:07:39,947 --> 00:07:43,337
Hasmet, it's good
that you've been sent here.

54
00:07:43,947 --> 00:07:47,303
Kemal Aslan. Tarik Aslan.

55
00:07:48,027 --> 00:07:51,019
Please make do with these for now,
in any case.

56
00:07:51,187 --> 00:07:53,382
The Turks here
don't know who you are.

57
00:07:53,547 --> 00:07:56,380
lf you happen to need anything,
call me.

58
00:07:56,547 --> 00:07:58,617
You are young men.
Do you understand?

59
00:07:59,707 --> 00:08:02,096
-Brother?. Are you okay?
-l'm fine, l'm fine.

60
00:08:02,267 --> 00:08:03,939
Let me see that wound.

61
00:08:05,427 --> 00:08:07,577
lt's infected.

62
00:08:07,707 --> 00:08:10,858
Don't you ever get bandaged up?
-l did it myself in the moming.

63
00:08:11,027 --> 00:08:12,380
-Alpago?
-Yes, sir.

64
00:08:12,547 --> 00:08:14,697
-Give me a pencil and paper.
-Of course, sir.

65
00:08:14,867 --> 00:08:17,506
Now, you are going to the address
written here. lt's our hospital.

66
00:08:17,667 --> 00:08:19,578
There won't be anything to do
with the police.

67
00:08:19,747 --> 00:08:21,817
They should bandage it up properly.

68
00:08:24,627 --> 00:08:26,265
What do you have on your hand?

69
00:08:29,747 --> 00:08:32,022
Okay, dad, okay.
Look, take your medication.

70
00:08:32,187 --> 00:08:35,736
You soak yourself from top to
bottom while gardening, that's why.

71
00:08:36,307 --> 00:08:38,263
Alright.
Okay, spoiled daddy.

72
00:08:38,427 --> 00:08:40,736
Okay, kisses,
don't worry about me, okay?

73
00:08:40,987 --> 00:08:42,340
Bye.

74
00:08:44,587 --> 00:08:48,262
-Why are you laughing?
-No reason. What are you eating?

75
00:08:48,427 --> 00:08:50,179
Didn't you bring this?
lt was on the counter.

76
00:08:50,347 --> 00:08:52,178
l spread it on some bread.
-Spit it out!

77
00:08:52,347 --> 00:08:53,621
Spit it out, girl,
there are walnuts in it!

78
00:08:53,787 --> 00:08:55,015
-What?
-Spit it out!

79
00:08:58,787 --> 00:09:01,255
Who's supposed to be
taking care of who?

80
00:09:01,427 --> 00:09:03,622
l brought you all the way here.
l'm tired.

81
00:09:03,747 --> 00:09:05,305
You take me a little ways, honey.

82
00:09:05,467 --> 00:09:07,822
You should have written
that it had walnuts in it, on it.

83
00:09:07,987 --> 00:09:09,466
lf you hadn't jumped on it
so fast,...

84
00:09:09,627 --> 00:09:11,504
...l suppose l would have had
the time to write on it.

85
00:09:11,707 --> 00:09:13,425
l'm all itchy.

86
00:09:38,307 --> 00:09:39,786
Who is that?

87
00:09:49,867 --> 00:09:51,698
l swear, it's a coincidence.

88
00:09:52,827 --> 00:09:54,499
You were walking though.

89
00:09:57,107 --> 00:10:01,942
My friend is allergic to walnuts and
got poisoned.

90
00:10:02,107 --> 00:10:03,665
Hi.

91
00:10:04,387 --> 00:10:08,141
What are you doing here?
-l came for bandages.

92
00:10:09,387 --> 00:10:13,505
-Did l claw you that bad?
-Yeah, l almost died.

93
00:10:14,547 --> 00:10:17,983
-l'm so sorry.
-Just kidding.

94
00:10:18,347 --> 00:10:20,656
l had a little accident,
that's all...

95
00:10:23,027 --> 00:10:25,257
Do you live here?

96
00:10:26,347 --> 00:10:28,622
''This was a question
without an answer.

97
00:10:28,787 --> 00:10:32,416
The only thing he knew was
that to live, he had to be here.

98
00:10:33,827 --> 00:10:36,216
But instead of answering,...

99
00:10:36,347 --> 00:10:40,022
...the man preferred to let himself
be intoxicated by hersweet voice.''

100
00:10:40,627 --> 00:10:45,496
l neverknew that this pain,

101
00:10:45,667 --> 00:10:53,096
Would cause you to stray,
And rob me of my heart.

102
00:10:53,267 --> 00:10:56,896
Look, she composed this song herself.
Very nice, isn't it?

103
00:10:57,947 --> 00:11:01,417
l don't know much about this kind of
music, but it sounds good.

104
00:11:01,587 --> 00:11:04,499
Do you work with music as well?

105
00:11:04,667 --> 00:11:08,296
No.
l came here to study English.

106
00:11:08,467 --> 00:11:10,537
Tourism is a good job
where l'm from.

107
00:11:10,747 --> 00:11:13,784
But everything changed
when l met lrem.

108
00:11:15,107 --> 00:11:18,019
My school is over, but l decided to
stay fora while longer.

109
00:11:18,187 --> 00:11:20,337
My fatherwas
a little hard to convince,...

110
00:11:20,467 --> 00:11:22,219
...but that's a separate topic.

111
00:11:22,347 --> 00:11:24,736
She was very helpful.
Even found me a job.

112
00:11:24,907 --> 00:11:27,057
By the way,
l'm a hairdresser.

113
00:11:27,187 --> 00:11:30,736
Ourshop is up ahead,
not too far away.

114
00:11:31,507 --> 00:11:34,624
Now, you tell me.
-What should l tell?

115
00:11:35,547 --> 00:11:37,265
Who is Kemal?

116
00:11:40,467 --> 00:11:43,937
l don't know.
We've only just met as well.

117
00:11:45,987 --> 00:11:49,138
You ran away from something
and have come to collect yourself.

118
00:11:49,267 --> 00:11:50,495
l get it.

119
00:11:52,107 --> 00:11:56,419
How long will you be here,
the wise man who sold his Ferrari?

120
00:11:58,107 --> 00:12:00,302
-Along time.
-How long?

121
00:12:00,467 --> 00:12:06,144
For example, three months,
a few weeks, a single day?

122
00:12:06,307 --> 00:12:08,696
You never know, fate is fate.

123
00:12:12,067 --> 00:12:15,457
Good, good.
Let him relax a little bit.

124
00:12:18,027 --> 00:12:19,016
Yes, sir.

125
00:12:20,147 --> 00:12:24,902
-Yourbrothers?
-That handsome one is my brother.

126
00:12:25,067 --> 00:12:29,106
Different mothers, same father.
My mother passed away.

127
00:12:29,267 --> 00:12:31,735
His motherraised me, Lady Fadile.

128
00:12:31,907 --> 00:12:34,705
Lady Fadile is a good person,
l consider herto be my mother.

129
00:12:34,867 --> 00:12:38,177
Alpago is like my brother,
his father left him to us.

130
00:12:39,147 --> 00:12:40,978
l lost my motheras well.

131
00:12:41,827 --> 00:12:46,059
But it has been a long time.
l can vaguely remember herface.

132
00:12:46,227 --> 00:12:50,061
She was a tough woman.
My dad is like a flower.

133
00:12:52,387 --> 00:12:55,902
But, my mom, you know...
l wish l she were here.

134
00:12:59,987 --> 00:13:01,386
What happened?

135
00:13:01,547 --> 00:13:02,900
Don't look at me like that,...

136
00:13:03,107 --> 00:13:05,382
...l can't look at anyone in the eyes
fortoo long.

137
00:13:08,227 --> 00:13:10,741
This orthis?

138
00:13:10,907 --> 00:13:12,101
The guy will stuff lahmacun
in yourmouth.

139
00:13:12,267 --> 00:13:13,746
You are going to come home
with yourmouth buming.

140
00:13:13,907 --> 00:13:17,183
So this shoe, orthis shoe?
Put on yourboots and go.

141
00:13:17,347 --> 00:13:20,384
How dare you talk about my lord
that way?

142
00:13:28,067 --> 00:13:29,625
What are you laughing at?

143
00:13:33,107 --> 00:13:34,506
Oh, nevermind.

144
00:13:35,587 --> 00:13:38,818
You have come
to do big things here now, huh?

145
00:13:38,987 --> 00:13:43,139
What big things? For example,
construction orsomething?

146
00:13:44,227 --> 00:13:45,945
Sort of.

147
00:13:47,707 --> 00:13:50,380
lt is what it is. Welcome.

148
00:13:50,947 --> 00:13:52,744
lt is good that you've come.

149
00:13:59,787 --> 00:14:01,300
Look, you are laughing again.

150
00:14:01,467 --> 00:14:03,344
Come on, tell me what's so funny,
so that l can laugh too.

151
00:14:03,547 --> 00:14:04,980
l'm laughing at lrem.

152
00:14:05,147 --> 00:14:08,344
She thought you would take me
to eat lahmacun.

153
00:14:08,507 --> 00:14:10,657
lf she were to see this...

154
00:14:12,387 --> 00:14:15,140
We are not at the level of
eating lahmacun yet.

155
00:14:16,027 --> 00:14:19,463
lf we were eating lahmacun, it would
mean that it's over and done.

156
00:14:21,307 --> 00:14:23,104
What's overand done?

157
00:14:26,387 --> 00:14:31,017
Look, l'm not so great
at this romantic stuff.

158
00:14:31,747 --> 00:14:33,180
Don't push it.

159
00:14:36,747 --> 00:14:38,544
You are such a different man.

160
00:14:38,707 --> 00:14:43,098
You are always walking around
with a posse. You neversmile.

161
00:14:43,267 --> 00:14:46,782
You are like a big sirtype,
but at the moment, in front of me...

162
00:14:46,947 --> 00:14:49,620
...you are an embarrassed kid,
a five year old child.

163
00:14:49,747 --> 00:14:53,456
Look, not smiling still.
l want to see yourteeth.

164
00:14:53,587 --> 00:14:54,906
Show me.

165
00:14:55,867 --> 00:14:58,700
-Wait, it hurts... Stop, it hurts.
-Show me yourteeth.

166
00:14:58,867 --> 00:15:03,099
-Stop, don't, how shameful!
-What's shameful, show me yourteeth.

167
00:15:15,747 --> 00:15:18,022
He wants to move faraway,
out of the city.

168
00:15:18,187 --> 00:15:20,621
l don't know,
it hasn't been even been a year.

169
00:15:20,787 --> 00:15:22,459
What should l do?

170
00:15:56,507 --> 00:15:58,702
Your eyes are like bottomless pits.

171
00:16:00,627 --> 00:16:03,505
l'm afraid of falling,
but they are drawing me in.

172
00:16:04,947 --> 00:16:07,222
With you, it's always the extremes.

173
00:16:08,547 --> 00:16:11,505
lt's eitherheaven orhell.

174
00:16:14,667 --> 00:16:16,339
Who are you, Kemal?

175
00:16:19,547 --> 00:16:21,265
l'm a speck of dust.

176
00:16:22,947 --> 00:16:26,701
One winds tossed,
carried to the clouds.

177
00:16:27,507 --> 00:16:31,420
Mixed with rains,
falling onto unknown lands.

178
00:16:31,587 --> 00:16:33,259
The prisoner of fate.

179
00:16:34,067 --> 00:16:38,345
l'm a speck of dust.
Ready for everything.

180
00:16:41,067 --> 00:16:43,023
Have you everbeen in love?

181
00:16:45,387 --> 00:16:49,062
Not enough to create poetry
while looking into a person's eyes.

182
00:16:50,747 --> 00:16:54,422
-Did you create this just now?
-Don't you like it?

183
00:17:01,947 --> 00:17:03,585
So, what about you?

184
00:17:04,147 --> 00:17:07,264
-What?
-Have you ever been in love?

185
00:17:16,747 --> 00:17:18,817
Stop.

186
00:17:20,907 --> 00:17:22,545
Don't look at me like that.

187
00:17:22,707 --> 00:17:25,540
l can't look at anyone in the eyes
fortoo long.

188
00:17:27,987 --> 00:17:30,501
Stop! Stop!

189
00:17:36,547 --> 00:17:38,538
''The man was in pain.

190
00:17:38,707 --> 00:17:42,905
lt was not because of his wound,
it was the pain of having killed.

191
00:17:45,467 --> 00:17:47,981
The girl touched his wounds.

192
00:17:50,707 --> 00:17:54,620
She didn't care about the reasons.
She only cared about one thing.''

193
00:17:55,147 --> 00:17:57,502
Does it hurt a lot?

194
00:18:01,427 --> 00:18:03,987
Can l get you some water?.
Do you want anything?

195
00:18:06,147 --> 00:18:07,660
Hold on.

196
00:18:40,947 --> 00:18:44,019
''Yagmur became the medicine
for Hasmet's wounds,...

197
00:18:44,187 --> 00:18:46,257
...it was the beginning of change.

198
00:18:46,747 --> 00:18:48,499
He was falling in love.

199
00:18:48,667 --> 00:18:52,660
Not just because she was
very beautiful, which she was.

200
00:18:54,107 --> 00:18:58,544
Hasmet was either changing,
orbecoming himself again.

201
00:18:59,747 --> 00:19:00,816
To love Yagmurwas...

202
00:19:00,987 --> 00:19:03,820
...to keep away from everything
he had lived through.

203
00:19:03,987 --> 00:19:08,139
lt was a great opportunity
to know himself again.

204
00:19:08,707 --> 00:19:09,822
He loved her.''

205
00:20:19,547 --> 00:20:21,822
''Winter doesn't only tum
a city cold,...

206
00:20:21,987 --> 00:20:24,217
...but some of the hearts
in it as well.''

207
00:20:34,027 --> 00:20:35,221
What happened?

208
00:20:35,387 --> 00:20:38,857
l bumed my finger in the pan,
it hurts, it hurts a lot.

209
00:20:42,547 --> 00:20:44,378
What are you doing?

210
00:20:52,147 --> 00:20:53,865
That feels so good.

211
00:20:57,907 --> 00:21:00,899
-The eggs are very good.
-Enjoy your meal.

212
00:21:01,267 --> 00:21:03,827
Stop eating that, you are nasty,
l put my finger in it.

213
00:21:03,987 --> 00:21:06,740
What's nasty?
Tastes like Kanlica yogurt.

214
00:21:18,987 --> 00:21:24,141
Kemal. l miss Turkey.
When do we go there?

215
00:21:24,307 --> 00:21:26,616
Also, l can't keep hiding you
from my fatheranymore.

216
00:21:26,747 --> 00:21:28,180
So, tell him.

217
00:21:28,347 --> 00:21:31,703
No, not like this.
l can't say it overthe phone.

218
00:21:31,867 --> 00:21:35,064
lf l go there now, l can break
the news about you gently.

219
00:21:35,227 --> 00:21:38,219
Then you can meet,
then perhaps...

220
00:21:39,227 --> 00:21:41,821
First, get my motherto like you,
the rest is easy.

221
00:21:41,987 --> 00:21:44,660
-Won't she like me?
-No, she is slow to like people.

222
00:21:44,827 --> 00:21:47,387
lf she wasn't,
would l be single now?

223
00:21:48,027 --> 00:21:51,383
How many girls have you introduced
to herso far?.

224
00:21:51,547 --> 00:21:53,902
You are an ass!

225
00:21:56,867 --> 00:21:58,425
l miss you so much.

226
00:21:59,107 --> 00:22:00,938
l am going to come.

227
00:22:01,427 --> 00:22:04,419
l am going to come,
but my fearof flying...

228
00:22:05,947 --> 00:22:08,381
Okay, dad, kisses, bye.

229
00:22:12,827 --> 00:22:14,658
Kemal, aren't we going to go out
fordinner?.

230
00:22:14,827 --> 00:22:16,260
You are making me eat
this disgusting thing.

231
00:22:16,427 --> 00:22:18,622
Wait, let me show them
how it's done.

232
00:22:23,707 --> 00:22:25,379
Are you alright, baby?

233
00:22:25,547 --> 00:22:29,062
You feed me this disgusting thing,
then you ask me if l'm alright.

234
00:22:47,707 --> 00:22:49,220
l can't tell him, mom.

235
00:22:49,387 --> 00:22:51,855
Let brother Hamza come
and tell him himself.

236
00:22:52,027 --> 00:22:54,382
He won't listen to me.
He will listen to him.

237
00:22:54,547 --> 00:22:56,663
Okay, l'm sending Hamza.

238
00:22:56,827 --> 00:22:59,022
Son, you take care of yourself
out there.

239
00:22:59,187 --> 00:23:00,700
Come on, man, come on.

240
00:23:01,547 --> 00:23:02,980
Come on, let's go.

241
00:23:04,267 --> 00:23:06,656
Are you sure?
Take a few more tests.

242
00:23:06,827 --> 00:23:09,625
l finished ten boxes,
it's all positive.

243
00:23:09,827 --> 00:23:14,696
You fell in love and got pregnant.
My dear...

244
00:23:14,867 --> 00:23:17,904
Wait, why are you crying?
Listen to me.

245
00:23:18,067 --> 00:23:19,739
Okay, okay, l got emotional.

246
00:23:19,947 --> 00:23:22,063
We met a yearago, today.

247
00:23:22,267 --> 00:23:24,861
l bought him a gift.
l will tell him when l present it.

248
00:23:24,987 --> 00:23:27,057
Girl, you are giving him
the best gift there is.

249
00:23:27,307 --> 00:23:30,697
l hope he cherishes it.
Oh, Tarik is there.

250
00:23:33,707 --> 00:23:37,382
Let's talk later, lrem, okay?
Kisses.

251
00:23:42,627 --> 00:23:45,585
Welcome, Tarik.
-Thank you, Yagmur.

252
00:23:47,867 --> 00:23:51,223
l got you everything that you wanted.
-Thank you.

253
00:23:51,867 --> 00:23:56,304
l was talking to lrem just now...
l've missed her.

254
00:24:00,267 --> 00:24:01,780
Did you hear it?

255
00:24:03,347 --> 00:24:04,746
l heard, Yagmur.

256
00:24:09,267 --> 00:24:11,178
Tarik, what will happen?
Please tell me.

257
00:24:11,347 --> 00:24:12,985
Are we going to Turkey?
What do we do?

258
00:24:13,187 --> 00:24:15,018
l can't tell my dad about this.

259
00:24:15,187 --> 00:24:16,506
Yagmur...

260
00:24:17,747 --> 00:24:19,305
Mr. Hamza has arrived,...

261
00:24:19,467 --> 00:24:22,425
...they are with my brother
at Necmi's place now. Talking.

262
00:24:22,547 --> 00:24:25,141
My brother might go to lstanbul.

263
00:24:25,307 --> 00:24:26,945
Have the problems
been taken care of?

264
00:24:27,107 --> 00:24:30,224
Look, Yagmur,
don't ask me anything now.

265
00:24:30,427 --> 00:24:32,702
Don't say anything to my brother
until he retums.

266
00:24:32,867 --> 00:24:35,506
lt will be betterto speak
when my brother has retumed.

267
00:24:35,667 --> 00:24:37,066
Trust me.

268
00:24:37,507 --> 00:24:41,261
-But...
-Yagmur... Trust me.

269
00:24:46,587 --> 00:24:48,896
They know of yourplace here.

270
00:24:49,067 --> 00:24:51,706
Sitki has been following you
fora few months.

271
00:24:51,867 --> 00:24:53,505
Now, they are also aware.

272
00:24:53,667 --> 00:24:56,135
The only thing we need
to end this conflict...

273
00:24:56,347 --> 00:24:58,622
...is for both sides
to show the white flag.

274
00:24:58,747 --> 00:25:02,626
We are on the verge of bankruptcy,
Hasmet. They are as well.

275
00:25:02,747 --> 00:25:06,660
Mr. Resit said, ''if Hasmet retums,
we will find a peaceful way''.

276
00:25:06,827 --> 00:25:08,658
What is this ''peaceful way'', Hamza?

277
00:25:08,867 --> 00:25:10,698
Are they trying to draw us out
into the open?

278
00:25:10,867 --> 00:25:13,620
No, they are not, trust me.

279
00:25:13,787 --> 00:25:17,063
Neitherside has the means
to keep this fight going.

280
00:25:19,067 --> 00:25:20,739
Brother Necmi, what do you think?

281
00:25:20,947 --> 00:25:22,744
Yesterday,
l spoke with Lady Fadile.

282
00:25:22,947 --> 00:25:25,745
She said, ''if Hasmet retums,
it will resolve this mess''.

283
00:25:25,867 --> 00:25:29,416
My opinion is that you go. Besides,
my guys will be there beside you.

284
00:25:29,587 --> 00:25:31,942
l know Resit,
he's not like his older brother.

285
00:25:32,107 --> 00:25:33,426
The guy is sick anyways.

286
00:25:33,547 --> 00:25:36,425
Obviously, he's trying to
make things right before he goes.

287
00:25:39,187 --> 00:25:41,417
''She's Pregnant''

288
00:25:49,147 --> 00:25:50,819
l'm fine, l'm fine.

289
00:25:53,667 --> 00:25:56,659
Hamza, Yagmur is asking,
will you stay overtonight?

290
00:25:56,867 --> 00:25:59,939
-No, no. l shouldn't.
-Stay.

291
00:26:00,107 --> 00:26:02,621
No, l'm going to go
and clean up around the place.

292
00:26:02,787 --> 00:26:04,220
Good.

293
00:26:04,347 --> 00:26:07,384
He won't, baby.
l have some good news.

294
00:26:08,107 --> 00:26:09,825
We will talk this evening.

295
00:26:14,387 --> 00:26:16,264
The captivity ends, huh?

296
00:26:16,427 --> 00:26:19,180
Can we leave the girl out of this,
Hasmet?

297
00:26:19,347 --> 00:26:22,464
-''The girl''?
-l mean Yagmur.

298
00:26:22,587 --> 00:26:24,782
Ourdestination is certain,
the center of the fire.

299
00:26:24,947 --> 00:26:26,266
lt's not clearwhat will happen.

300
00:26:26,387 --> 00:26:28,537
She doesn't know the customs,
orthe people...

301
00:26:28,707 --> 00:26:31,346
What is she going to do there?
-l know what to do, Hamza.

302
00:26:38,747 --> 00:26:41,784
No one knows how to mess things up
betterthan him.

303
00:26:41,987 --> 00:26:44,501
He says he knows what to do.

304
00:26:44,627 --> 00:26:46,458
He should,
since he screwed everything up.

305
00:26:46,667 --> 00:26:48,385
How can he speak to me like that?

306
00:26:48,587 --> 00:26:50,145
What are you mumbling about, Hamza?

307
00:26:50,307 --> 00:26:52,263
Aunt, l'm retuming.

308
00:26:52,747 --> 00:26:53,702
How was it?

309
00:26:53,867 --> 00:26:56,745
l swearto God, l don't know
if it went good orif it went bad.

310
00:26:56,907 --> 00:26:58,579
This girl will be a nuisance.

311
00:26:58,747 --> 00:27:00,817
Hamza, that issue will be handled.

312
00:27:01,867 --> 00:27:03,346
Aunt, she's pregnant.

313
00:27:05,587 --> 00:27:06,622
Can you hearme, aunt?

314
00:27:06,827 --> 00:27:09,057
Hamza,
l will not repeat what l said.

315
00:27:09,227 --> 00:27:11,024
Aunt, l...
She's pregnant, what can l do?

316
00:27:11,187 --> 00:27:13,257
Do l need to tell you what to do?

317
00:27:13,627 --> 00:27:15,822
Do whatever is necessary.

318
00:27:40,267 --> 00:27:41,939
We had met on this day, last year.

319
00:27:44,707 --> 00:27:46,504
l hurt this hand.

320
00:27:51,227 --> 00:27:54,936
This is an apology addressed
from this hand, to this one.

321
00:27:57,627 --> 00:27:59,743
But this is not a simple watch.

322
00:28:07,747 --> 00:28:09,385
lt's very nice.

323
00:28:19,307 --> 00:28:20,979
We are leaving.

324
00:28:28,747 --> 00:28:30,465
Don't scream, stop.

325
00:28:32,027 --> 00:28:33,096
Are you serious?

326
00:28:33,307 --> 00:28:37,858
Things worked out, but first,
l have to go to Turkey alone.

327
00:28:41,107 --> 00:28:44,144
Look, when l retum,
everything will have changed.

328
00:28:44,307 --> 00:28:45,899
What if you don't retum?

329
00:28:46,587 --> 00:28:49,181
Take me with you, please.
l will go crazy here without you.

330
00:28:49,307 --> 00:28:53,903
Don't worry, Tarik will be here.
He will not leave you alone.

331
00:28:54,067 --> 00:28:55,898
l have to go.

332
00:28:56,027 --> 00:28:58,222
When l come back,
l will have solved everything.

333
00:28:58,387 --> 00:29:00,025
Then, we will go together.

334
00:29:03,787 --> 00:29:05,937
You are coming back, aren't you?

335
00:29:22,387 --> 00:29:24,423
Will you be my wife?

336
00:29:27,867 --> 00:29:29,619
Yes.

337
00:29:48,387 --> 00:29:51,379
When you get back,
l will have a surprise for you.

338
00:30:13,587 --> 00:30:14,576
-Welcome, Mr. Hasmet.
-Hello.

339
00:30:14,707 --> 00:30:17,346
-Brother, welcome.
-My dearsister!

340
00:30:19,187 --> 00:30:22,259
Did you miss me?
-How can l not miss my brother?

341
00:30:22,387 --> 00:30:24,981
-Ask me about it. Where is mom?
-lnside, waiting for you.

342
00:30:25,147 --> 00:30:26,375
Come on.

343
00:30:29,267 --> 00:30:31,701
l'm your mothertoo.

344
00:30:31,867 --> 00:30:34,745
My heart hurts for you
when something happens,...

345
00:30:34,867 --> 00:30:37,256
...just as if it had happened
to Turhan.

346
00:30:37,427 --> 00:30:41,306
Only God knows what l had to
endure here forthe past year.

347
00:30:41,467 --> 00:30:45,619
There is no otherway.
This is your responsibility.

348
00:30:45,827 --> 00:30:49,456
Only you can handle this situation.

349
00:30:53,947 --> 00:30:58,816
l don't have it in me,
nor does this family...

350
00:30:58,947 --> 00:31:02,781
...to lift anotherfuneral
from this house.

351
00:31:03,747 --> 00:31:07,660
Hasmet, they know
where you are staying there.

352
00:31:07,867 --> 00:31:09,983
lf you care about this family...

353
00:31:10,147 --> 00:31:14,299
...and what your late father
entrusted to you,...

354
00:31:14,507 --> 00:31:16,020
...you will do it.

355
00:31:19,427 --> 00:31:21,258
Where is Hamza?

356
00:31:21,427 --> 00:31:25,056
At ourhometown. From there,
he is organizing the attendees.

357
00:31:25,227 --> 00:31:27,343
He will be here
on the day of the meeting.

358
00:31:46,427 --> 00:31:49,305
-Yagmur?
-Tarik.

359
00:31:59,947 --> 00:32:04,418
-Tarik, where are we?
-lt's a surprise, Yagmur. Asurprise.

360
00:32:12,347 --> 00:32:14,815
-lt's Kemal.
-Yagmur, give me the phone.

361
00:32:15,027 --> 00:32:18,099
Look, you are going to mess up
the whole surprise. Come on.

362
00:32:35,547 --> 00:32:36,866
Hamza?

363
00:32:38,987 --> 00:32:40,784
Tarik, what's going on?

364
00:32:46,907 --> 00:32:48,386
Sit down.

365
00:32:54,867 --> 00:32:58,177
Do you know
who it is that you are with?

366
00:32:59,907 --> 00:33:01,738
What does that mean, Hamza?

367
00:33:03,947 --> 00:33:06,541
lt means,
the fairy tale is over now.

368
00:33:06,707 --> 00:33:08,743
Now come the facts.

369
00:33:23,867 --> 00:33:25,823
His name is Hasmet.

370
00:33:26,267 --> 00:33:28,223
Hasmet Ayaz.
Before he came here,...

371
00:33:28,387 --> 00:33:32,062
...he killed the head of one of
Turkey's most dangerous families.

372
00:33:32,227 --> 00:33:34,263
He killed Mr. lhsan.

373
00:33:36,187 --> 00:33:38,496
That is why
he has been here for a year.

374
00:33:38,667 --> 00:33:40,623
What did he tell you
about his wounds?

375
00:33:40,747 --> 00:33:45,343
This is the shootout
where he was injured.

376
00:33:46,587 --> 00:33:49,465
They wanted to get things done
themselves.

377
00:33:49,627 --> 00:33:53,256
That's why, this issue was reflected
differently to the police.

378
00:33:54,627 --> 00:33:57,380
Both families
have had many funerals.

379
00:33:59,987 --> 00:34:04,105
Finally, through my efforts,
we came to an agreement.

380
00:34:04,267 --> 00:34:05,905
lf this agreement goes through,...

381
00:34:06,027 --> 00:34:09,064
...it ends the rage that's been
going on formany years.

382
00:34:09,267 --> 00:34:12,259
Both families will be able to avoid
bankruptcy.

383
00:34:12,427 --> 00:34:15,066
Here's the only one obstacle
in theirway:

384
00:34:16,587 --> 00:34:17,906
You.

385
00:34:21,307 --> 00:34:22,501
Who, me?

386
00:34:22,707 --> 00:34:25,824
To get rid of you, both families
will do everything they can.

387
00:34:26,107 --> 00:34:27,825
They know
where Hasmet is hiding here.

388
00:34:27,987 --> 00:34:29,306
They know about you as well.

389
00:34:29,507 --> 00:34:33,136
There is no othersolution,
you must leave Hasmet.

390
00:34:33,667 --> 00:34:36,579
l don't believe you,
let him tell me himself.

391
00:34:36,707 --> 00:34:39,346
When he retums,
he will tell you the same.

392
00:34:39,507 --> 00:34:42,544
What l'm saying is,
no matterwhat he tells you,...

393
00:34:42,707 --> 00:34:45,301
...you shouldn't go back to Turkey
with him.

394
00:34:52,987 --> 00:34:56,946
-l'm pregnant.
-Yes, we know.

395
00:35:02,707 --> 00:35:05,505
lt would be much easier
if you weren't,...

396
00:35:07,107 --> 00:35:09,985
...but we will take care of that,
don't worry.

397
00:35:11,147 --> 00:35:14,378
What do you mean,
you will take care of it?

398
00:35:16,627 --> 00:35:18,379
What do you mean,
you will take care of it?

399
00:35:18,547 --> 00:35:20,856
Let's get you off to this side,
the doctorwill take care of it.

400
00:35:21,027 --> 00:35:22,824
Let go, let go!
What are you doing? Let go!

401
00:35:22,987 --> 00:35:26,263
What are you doing?
Tarik! Tarik, help me, please!

402
00:35:26,427 --> 00:35:28,497
-Brother Hamza!
-l don't think you understand me!

403
00:35:28,667 --> 00:35:31,181
l said there is a blood feud,
Hasmet will die.

404
00:35:31,347 --> 00:35:33,338
This is not a joke.
l don't make jokes.

405
00:35:33,507 --> 00:35:36,226
Now, get rid of that bastard
and go away, or l will kill you!

406
00:35:36,387 --> 00:35:37,342
Brother...

407
00:35:50,187 --> 00:35:51,984
l'm going to the airport.

408
00:35:53,147 --> 00:35:56,662
When this is done, take herback
to where you picked her up.

409
00:35:57,387 --> 00:35:59,855
Explain to herwhat she should do
very carefully.

410
00:36:00,027 --> 00:36:01,904
What we are doing is wrong.

411
00:36:03,147 --> 00:36:06,617
So, all what's been done to date
is alright, but this is wrong.

412
00:36:06,747 --> 00:36:10,296
Come on, Turhan, come on,
do as you are told.

413
00:36:19,267 --> 00:36:20,825
This is illegal.

414
00:37:05,587 --> 00:37:07,225
Yagmur!

415
00:37:56,027 --> 00:38:01,897
From the day l lost my brother,
a part of me has been gone as well.

416
00:38:02,027 --> 00:38:04,700
Another death...

417
00:38:05,947 --> 00:38:08,620
...will disturb me in my grave.

418
00:38:09,027 --> 00:38:10,824
Turhan is young.

419
00:38:12,467 --> 00:38:13,946
Sitki...

420
00:38:14,667 --> 00:38:16,259
You...

421
00:38:16,587 --> 00:38:19,659
Hamza...
lt would be a pity.

422
00:38:19,867 --> 00:38:24,099
Some of you are in the soil,
a bunch of you are in prison.

423
00:38:24,707 --> 00:38:27,744
The young
will control theirtempers.

424
00:38:29,587 --> 00:38:32,579
There is a blessing in a wedding.

425
00:38:33,467 --> 00:38:37,142
This so-called peace
should not just be said in words.

426
00:38:38,387 --> 00:38:41,345
Through marriage,
the blood feud will stop.

427
00:38:42,547 --> 00:38:45,107
Marry ourdaughter, Nupelda.

428
00:38:45,747 --> 00:38:48,102
Then, we will become relatives.

429
00:38:49,187 --> 00:38:54,864
The hundreds of members of
this family will only allow as such.

430
00:38:55,707 --> 00:38:59,700
Nupe, she grew up
on the same streets as you.

431
00:38:59,987 --> 00:39:02,182
She knows you.

432
00:39:02,627 --> 00:39:04,902
We asked her.
We received her approval.

433
00:39:05,067 --> 00:39:06,580
lt was voluntary.

434
00:39:07,267 --> 00:39:11,021
Let this rage end.
Provide us with grandkids.

435
00:39:11,147 --> 00:39:14,298
Nothing else will douse this fire.

436
00:39:15,747 --> 00:39:21,743
Now, if there is anyone against this
marriage, let them leave here now.

437
00:39:36,027 --> 00:39:37,745
l don't need your permission!

438
00:39:38,307 --> 00:39:39,626
What's this supposed to mean?

439
00:39:39,747 --> 00:39:41,817
l'll nevertrust you, Hasmet!

440
00:39:42,507 --> 00:39:44,099
Hasmet!

441
00:39:57,627 --> 00:39:59,379
Be wise!

442
00:40:02,307 --> 00:40:04,741
Everybody should be wise.

443
00:40:38,427 --> 00:40:42,340
''Hasmet was the man she loved
since childhood.

444
00:40:53,227 --> 00:40:55,741
The woman thought:
'Who am l looking at?'

445
00:40:55,907 --> 00:40:57,898
Was it herhusband,...

446
00:40:58,067 --> 00:41:00,217
...or herfather's killer?''

447
00:41:06,747 --> 00:41:08,180
What are you doing?

448
00:41:08,307 --> 00:41:11,026
You are trying to add fuel to a fire
we are trying to put out.

449
00:41:11,147 --> 00:41:14,059
All of the efforts we had to put in
just to get it to this point...

450
00:41:14,227 --> 00:41:16,024
What do you want,
Turhan to be killed?

451
00:41:16,187 --> 00:41:17,745
Should they just shoot you again?

452
00:41:17,867 --> 00:41:21,018
Do you want to lose everything
yourfatherleft behind?

453
00:41:25,747 --> 00:41:27,817
Tell them to wait for my answer.

454
00:41:29,547 --> 00:41:31,503
You don't need to go.

455
00:41:33,707 --> 00:41:37,461
l told Turhan,
he told Yagmureverything.

456
00:41:38,627 --> 00:41:43,018
Hamza... Hamza...
Hamza, what did you do?

457
00:41:43,187 --> 00:41:44,825
She's looking at us.

458
00:42:33,867 --> 00:42:36,222
l heard she escaped,
why didn't you tell me?

459
00:42:36,907 --> 00:42:38,659
Calm down, listen.

460
00:42:38,827 --> 00:42:40,579
''Calm down''?
What do you mean, ''calm down''?

461
00:42:40,747 --> 00:42:45,184
She fled,
but had an accident while fleeing.

462
00:42:45,347 --> 00:42:47,065
Kemal...

463
00:42:49,907 --> 00:42:51,579
She had a miscarriage.

464
00:42:55,907 --> 00:43:00,537
That's God work for you. You see?
He didn't will it either.

465
00:43:01,747 --> 00:43:04,307
You are sure, right?

466
00:43:04,587 --> 00:43:08,375
The doctor just left.
The girl is miserable.

467
00:43:09,067 --> 00:43:10,182
She had a miscarriage.

468
00:43:10,347 --> 00:43:11,985
Hamza, food is ready.

469
00:43:14,067 --> 00:43:15,386
Good.

470
00:43:16,427 --> 00:43:18,543
Look, Hasmet is on his way there.
Now, the rest is up to you.

471
00:43:18,707 --> 00:43:19,901
That girl will not come here.

472
00:43:21,587 --> 00:43:22,906
Alright.

473
00:43:42,747 --> 00:43:44,146
Why?

474
00:43:46,667 --> 00:43:50,455
They want him to marry
the daughterof the man he killed.

475
00:43:51,467 --> 00:43:53,742
My brotherhas to do it.

476
00:43:53,987 --> 00:43:59,903
This blood feud is to be eliminated
through a wedding.

477
00:44:00,227 --> 00:44:02,866
The situation is very serious.

478
00:44:03,027 --> 00:44:04,858
You have to go.

479
00:44:05,547 --> 00:44:08,015
lf you won't think about yourself,
think about my brother.

480
00:44:08,187 --> 00:44:10,417
This is no joke,
they will kill him.

481
00:44:12,307 --> 00:44:14,343
lf my brothercomes here,
sees you,...

482
00:44:14,507 --> 00:44:17,419
...he won't let go
when he finds out about the baby.

483
00:44:17,587 --> 00:44:21,739
He will endanger
both his life and yours.

484
00:44:22,187 --> 00:44:28,183
Yagmur, if you love my brother,
stay away from him.

485
00:44:33,027 --> 00:44:35,257
He proposed to me.

486
00:44:46,267 --> 00:44:51,580
There is no otherchoice, Yagmur.
lf you love my brother, leave.

487
00:44:53,267 --> 00:44:54,700
Go, Yagmur.

488
00:44:55,747 --> 00:44:58,466
lf you love my brother.

489
00:45:24,027 --> 00:45:25,619
Yagmur!

490
00:45:28,587 --> 00:45:30,066
Yagmur!

491
00:45:34,827 --> 00:45:36,863
Where is she?
-She's gone.

492
00:45:36,987 --> 00:45:38,215
Where did she go?

493
00:45:38,387 --> 00:45:40,776
Hamza said to tell her,
so l told her.

494
00:45:40,947 --> 00:45:43,745
She took her belongings and took off.
l couldn't stop her.

495
00:45:45,227 --> 00:45:46,899
What do you mean
you couldn't stop her?

496
00:45:47,067 --> 00:45:49,581
Hamza told me that you knew,
and so l told her.

497
00:45:49,747 --> 00:45:51,385
What should l have done?

498
00:46:03,867 --> 00:46:05,744
Why do you have her phone?

499
00:46:05,907 --> 00:46:08,421
She forgot it on herway out,
on the table.

500
00:46:08,547 --> 00:46:10,981
Get out of here!

501
00:46:15,947 --> 00:46:19,383
''That powerful man was crying
in the middle of the city.

502
00:46:19,587 --> 00:46:21,737
The burdens
that he thought he had left behind...

503
00:46:21,907 --> 00:46:23,738
...were, again,
riding on his shoulders,...

504
00:46:23,907 --> 00:46:25,818
...more severe and more cruel
this time.''

505
00:46:28,347 --> 00:46:30,656
l nevertrusted that man
in the first place.

506
00:46:30,827 --> 00:46:32,783
Yagmur, my baby...

507
00:46:35,187 --> 00:46:36,984
No way,
no way will he everfind you again.

508
00:46:37,187 --> 00:46:38,540
God damn him.

509
00:46:38,707 --> 00:46:41,346
Don't curse him.
He doesn't even know about it.

510
00:46:41,507 --> 00:46:45,386
-Look at you...
-lrem, what do l do now?

511
00:46:46,747 --> 00:46:48,977
ls this the point
they have brought you to?

512
00:46:49,147 --> 00:46:52,139
Were you like this before?
Let him go on looking for you.

513
00:46:52,307 --> 00:46:55,026
Kemal is such a jerk!
What, so his name was Hasmet...

514
00:46:55,187 --> 00:46:57,143
The man is a complete fraud.

515
00:47:12,507 --> 00:47:13,462
What happened?

516
00:47:14,947 --> 00:47:15,902
What's going on?

517
00:47:16,427 --> 00:47:17,701
lrem, is he here?

518
00:47:34,387 --> 00:47:37,777
Hello, lrem. Yagmurand l
have been going through some things.

519
00:47:37,947 --> 00:47:40,984
l can't find her.
l thought she would be here.

520
00:47:43,907 --> 00:47:48,025
Look, it wasn't my fault.
There's something l need to tell her.

521
00:47:48,227 --> 00:47:49,455
lf she's here,
let me just talk to her.

522
00:47:49,627 --> 00:47:51,106
Come with me.

523
00:48:00,587 --> 00:48:02,737
Look, Kemal,
orwhoever you are.

524
00:48:02,907 --> 00:48:04,499
She's a strangerto yourworld.

525
00:48:04,667 --> 00:48:07,056
She sees these things only
from watching TVand movies.

526
00:48:07,227 --> 00:48:09,138
l think you should
stop chasing her.

527
00:48:09,347 --> 00:48:11,815
Leave the girl and us alone.
-Yagmur?

528
00:48:11,987 --> 00:48:12,976
-Kemal, stop.
-Let go.

529
00:48:13,187 --> 00:48:16,145
-Kemal, l said ''stop''.
-Let me go, lrem.

530
00:48:16,267 --> 00:48:17,541
-Kemal, no.
-Hey!

531
00:48:17,707 --> 00:48:20,016
-Yagmur! lrem, get off me!
-l said ''no''!

532
00:48:20,947 --> 00:48:21,902
Yagmur!

533
00:48:22,947 --> 00:48:23,902
Yagmur!

534
00:48:27,707 --> 00:48:28,662
Yagmur!

535
00:49:08,507 --> 00:49:10,179
Kemal...

536
00:49:35,387 --> 00:49:38,504
Kemal!

537
00:49:56,827 --> 00:49:59,102
You know, he was deported,
he can't go back.

538
00:49:59,267 --> 00:50:01,383
But he may ask you to help.

539
00:50:01,587 --> 00:50:02,986
Necmi.

540
00:50:04,587 --> 00:50:06,259
Keep that girl away from Hasmet.

541
00:50:06,467 --> 00:50:10,062
Don't worry, Lady Fadile, l am aware
of the seriousness of the situation.

542
00:50:10,267 --> 00:50:13,577
He called me already,
l'll handle it.

543
00:50:17,707 --> 00:50:19,618
You saw them there.

544
00:50:21,747 --> 00:50:24,102
A blonde, huh?

545
00:50:25,547 --> 00:50:26,821
Was she pretty?

546
00:50:32,947 --> 00:50:35,017
Pathetic, compared to you.

547
00:50:36,267 --> 00:50:38,223
Ah, Nupe...

548
00:50:38,547 --> 00:50:41,425
You think l would have been that
quiet if you weren't there, huh?

549
00:50:41,587 --> 00:50:43,657
l would have killed all of them.

550
00:50:44,427 --> 00:50:47,180
That man shot my father,
he died in my arms.

551
00:50:47,347 --> 00:50:50,544
Now, l call ourfather's killer
my brother-in-law, huh?

552
00:50:50,667 --> 00:50:53,784
Anyways, l won't say anything.

553
00:50:54,787 --> 00:50:57,699
But just so you know this, sister,
l will always be alert.

554
00:50:58,227 --> 00:51:00,980
l won't accept it. l can't.

555
00:51:02,707 --> 00:51:04,937
Not a sound from you, Sitki.

556
00:51:05,507 --> 00:51:08,305
You won't make a single sound
until l tell you.

557
00:51:11,507 --> 00:51:14,067
You will bear it until l say so.

558
00:51:31,187 --> 00:51:33,018
Of course l'm sorry
forwhat has happened.

559
00:51:33,187 --> 00:51:36,099
As l said, l found the girl.
l was kicked out.

560
00:51:36,267 --> 00:51:37,939
Unspeakable remarks were made.

561
00:51:38,627 --> 00:51:40,936
You know that other girl,
the girl that's with her...

562
00:51:41,107 --> 00:51:43,302
They relocated to Canada.

563
00:51:43,427 --> 00:51:44,621
Never mind now, nevermind.

564
00:51:44,787 --> 00:51:46,539
Look, things are working out
overthere.

565
00:51:46,707 --> 00:51:48,538
Don't go raising this topic.

566
00:51:48,707 --> 00:51:52,097
Okay, Necmi, okay.
Thank you.

567
00:52:00,907 --> 00:52:02,386
Hush.

568
00:52:02,627 --> 00:52:04,106
Hush, don't bark.

569
00:52:05,227 --> 00:52:08,981
Our girl has come.
Ourgirl...

570
00:52:09,587 --> 00:52:11,737
My daughter, Yagmur.

571
00:52:11,907 --> 00:52:14,501
When did you get here?
Why didn't you let me know?

572
00:52:14,667 --> 00:52:17,022
Since when
have you been sitting there?

573
00:52:20,107 --> 00:52:21,825
Daddy, l've missed you so much.

574
00:52:21,947 --> 00:52:26,975
My dear, my dear,
don't cry, my baby.

575
00:52:34,547 --> 00:52:37,619
''She was weak and desperate.

576
00:52:38,107 --> 00:52:40,575
She was taking on sorrows
she had never known.

577
00:52:42,947 --> 00:52:46,257
She tried, but she couldn't do it.

578
00:52:46,427 --> 00:52:49,624
She couldn't end the baby's life.

579
00:52:49,747 --> 00:52:52,136
Perhaps, giving birth
would be just the thing...

580
00:52:52,307 --> 00:52:54,946
...to save herfrom this situation
she felt powerless over,...

581
00:52:55,107 --> 00:52:58,782
...so the woman thought.
As the rain poured overher.''

582
00:53:03,867 --> 00:53:07,416
Did you notice, did you see
how the garden has expanded?

583
00:53:08,227 --> 00:53:12,106
l'll talk to the mayor and
get that wall demolished as well.

584
00:53:12,267 --> 00:53:14,258
Then, this will be a huge place.

585
00:53:14,427 --> 00:53:18,340
When you get married,
we can have the wedding here.

586
00:53:18,467 --> 00:53:20,856
Since we will have a big garden.

587
00:53:22,707 --> 00:53:24,823
My dear, my beautiful girl.

588
00:53:26,667 --> 00:53:31,263
Only if yourmotherwas alive and
could have seen you all grown up...

589
00:53:31,427 --> 00:53:34,783
She would have been dancing
at yourwedding with me.

590
00:53:36,187 --> 00:53:39,020
She would take her grandchild
into herarms,...

591
00:53:39,187 --> 00:53:43,180
...and shout at us like she used to.
She would say ''be quiet''.

592
00:53:45,507 --> 00:53:48,977
l miss taking heron
when she was angry.

593
00:53:52,187 --> 00:53:54,143
Dad, l'm pregnant.

594
00:53:56,587 --> 00:53:58,305
Pregnant?

595
00:54:01,307 --> 00:54:03,582
Dad, we were going to get married.

596
00:54:03,747 --> 00:54:06,819
But please don't ask about it,
l can't tell you.

597
00:54:08,187 --> 00:54:11,543
Yesterday, l went to get an abortion,
but l couldn't do it.

598
00:54:11,707 --> 00:54:15,222
l feel it in my tummy, dad.

599
00:54:22,587 --> 00:54:23,815
Dad.

600
00:54:27,707 --> 00:54:31,746
''His daughter's baby and the facts
she could not speak of...

601
00:54:31,907 --> 00:54:33,943
...were a bit too much
for a father...

602
00:54:34,107 --> 00:54:36,905
...who was just trying to improve
his garden.

603
00:54:37,107 --> 00:54:41,976
Neitherthis town, or his heart,
was a place able to understand it.''

604
00:55:48,907 --> 00:55:51,102
The first kiss with you...

605
00:55:51,987 --> 00:55:53,864
The first time being with you...

606
00:55:56,507 --> 00:55:59,658
l always imagined doing these
things forthe first time with you.

607
00:56:01,867 --> 00:56:04,939
There is someone else on your mind,
l know.

608
00:56:06,387 --> 00:56:08,696
l heard she's a blonde girl.

609
00:56:11,347 --> 00:56:14,419
But l'm yourwoman now, Hasmet.

610
00:56:17,587 --> 00:56:20,181
Nupelda...

611
00:56:21,787 --> 00:56:24,017
Will you be able to love me?

612
00:56:31,347 --> 00:56:32,666
ls that necessary?

613
00:56:39,667 --> 00:56:43,580
Dad?
Dad, won't you talk to me?

614
00:57:08,107 --> 00:57:12,339
l need you to trust me, dad.
l can't tell you.

615
00:57:12,667 --> 00:57:16,023
You are carrying the child of a man
who l don't even know.

616
00:57:16,187 --> 00:57:19,702
You come home,
then say ''trust me''.

617
00:57:19,867 --> 00:57:23,655
How can l face the people
in this town? You neverthink that.

618
00:57:23,827 --> 00:57:26,819
When l go to yourmother's grave,
how do l explain this to her?

619
00:57:27,027 --> 00:57:29,257
What do l tell that child?
How can l hold it?

620
00:57:29,427 --> 00:57:30,462
You neverthink.

621
00:57:30,627 --> 00:57:32,743
But you can stand before me and say
''trust me''.

622
00:57:32,947 --> 00:57:37,065
Don't trust me, girl.
Don't trust me.

623
00:57:37,707 --> 00:57:39,823
l will not take care of that child
in this house.

624
00:57:39,987 --> 00:57:41,500
l will not call it my grandchild.

625
00:57:41,667 --> 00:57:46,821
lf you want to give birth
to that child, do it elsewhere.

626
00:57:47,427 --> 00:57:49,702
And from now on, don't call me ''dad''.

627
00:57:52,467 --> 00:57:54,935
-Dad, come on, please.
-l said ''don't call me dad''!

628
01:00:06,387 --> 01:00:07,866
Yourdaughter's got a bun
in the oven.

629
01:00:08,027 --> 01:00:10,416
Where's the groom?
Won't he make an appearance?

630
01:00:18,227 --> 01:00:21,617
He's a soldier, a soldier.
When he comes back from the army.

631
01:00:26,987 --> 01:00:28,864
What should l do now, woman?

632
01:00:29,027 --> 01:00:33,145
l can't discard it, l can't
put it off, l can't kick her out...

633
01:00:34,067 --> 01:00:37,025
Should l kill myself,
should l kill her, what do l do?

634
01:00:37,747 --> 01:00:40,136
You will forgive me, dad.

635
01:00:44,427 --> 01:00:48,102
l am your daughter,
and this is yourgrandchild.

636
01:00:48,267 --> 01:00:52,897
l broke your heart, l know.
But my heart is broken too.

637
01:00:53,067 --> 01:00:56,025
l fell in love, dad! lt was not with
just some random guy!

638
01:00:56,187 --> 01:01:00,180
Don't speak!
Don't tell me, tell yourmom!

639
01:01:00,347 --> 01:01:03,464
Let's see if she will forgive you!
lf yourmotherwas alive now,...

640
01:01:03,627 --> 01:01:06,141
...she would have caved your head in
with a stone!

641
01:01:14,707 --> 01:01:17,699
Cave my head in then, dad.
You can do it too.

642
01:01:19,267 --> 01:01:22,259
Go, girl, leave!
Donat make me kill my own child!

643
01:01:22,427 --> 01:01:25,260
lf you will not forgive me,
then kill me!

644
01:01:25,427 --> 01:01:27,304
l give you my blessing!

645
01:01:27,467 --> 01:01:29,981
Eitherkill me orforgive me, dad!

646
01:01:31,747 --> 01:01:33,465
Let God forgive you, my daughter.

647
01:01:33,587 --> 01:01:35,976
l will not take that kid on my lap,
do you understand?

648
01:01:36,147 --> 01:01:38,297
l will not take that kid on my lap!

649
01:01:47,387 --> 01:01:49,742
Yagmur... Yagmur!

650
01:01:50,027 --> 01:01:51,255
Yagmur!
-Dad!

651
01:01:51,427 --> 01:01:53,019
My girl!

652
01:01:53,387 --> 01:01:56,584
ls anybody there?

653
01:01:56,867 --> 01:01:59,427
Hang on, girl, hang on.

654
01:01:59,907 --> 01:02:02,740
Call a doctor, run, run!

655
01:02:02,907 --> 01:02:05,740
Hold on, dear,
there is a doctorcoming, hold on.

656
01:02:08,387 --> 01:02:10,343
Woman, what do l do now?

657
01:03:19,307 --> 01:03:21,298
Kemal!

658
01:03:22,427 --> 01:03:25,703
Unfortunately, these results are
negative too, Mrs. Nupelda.

659
01:03:25,867 --> 01:03:28,062
But there are new techniques
developing every day.

660
01:03:28,227 --> 01:03:30,900
There are a few more methods l would
like to offeras treatment for you.

661
01:03:31,067 --> 01:03:33,786
lf you let me,
we can start a new treatment.

662
01:03:48,507 --> 01:03:52,898
You are coming to the meeting.
Pick yourself up a little.

663
01:03:55,107 --> 01:03:57,337
lt didn't work this time either.

664
01:04:00,027 --> 01:04:03,064
But we'll try again
with anothermethod.

665
01:04:05,387 --> 01:04:08,936
l want to give you a child so much.

666
01:04:19,987 --> 01:04:22,979
''ln the mirror,
she only saw someone...

667
01:04:23,147 --> 01:04:26,059
...who is trying to be a woman
with herdamaged femininity.

668
01:04:26,227 --> 01:04:28,695
She felt incomplete.''

669
01:04:29,067 --> 01:04:32,537
To get this hotel back will be
too tiring forus at the moment.

670
01:04:32,707 --> 01:04:37,735
We have neitherthe personnel
northe time to deal with this thing.

671
01:04:38,747 --> 01:04:41,215
We are here forsentimental reasons.

672
01:04:41,387 --> 01:04:44,140
This hotel has been run by this
family for overtwenty years.

673
01:04:44,307 --> 01:04:46,343
We know how valuable it is.

674
01:04:46,507 --> 01:04:49,305
Think about my offer,
and get back to me.

675
01:04:50,827 --> 01:04:52,385
Yes, Mr. Hasmet.

676
01:04:53,267 --> 01:04:57,385
Wait a minute, wait a minute.
This business will end here today.

677
01:04:57,547 --> 01:04:59,265
That's what we are here for,
Mrs. Nupelda.

678
01:04:59,427 --> 01:05:01,657
That's exactly
what we are doing.

679
01:05:01,827 --> 01:05:04,387
No. Yourgoal is to take advantage
of ourweaknesses,...

680
01:05:04,547 --> 01:05:06,902
...and sell off the hotel to us
at an exorbitant price.

681
01:05:09,227 --> 01:05:10,979
lf you were sitting
in front of my uncle,...

682
01:05:11,147 --> 01:05:13,297
...he would have ripped yourtongue
out of yourhead.

683
01:05:18,347 --> 01:05:20,497
l miss you so much.

684
01:05:22,747 --> 01:05:23,702
Hasmet!

685
01:05:23,867 --> 01:05:26,745
lf you evertry to undermine
my authority again, l'll kill you.

686
01:05:26,947 --> 01:05:29,097
You are the one letting them
undermine yourauthority.

687
01:05:29,267 --> 01:05:30,780
You let them spit
on ourfamily values.

688
01:05:30,947 --> 01:05:33,256
lt was a bluff. They will
get back to us within two days.

689
01:05:33,427 --> 01:05:35,736
They can't sell it to anyone but us,
and you know it.

690
01:05:38,347 --> 01:05:41,498
Do you know why
we can't have kids?

691
01:05:42,747 --> 01:05:46,023
Because you can't get that bimbo
out of yourmind.

692
01:05:46,187 --> 01:05:49,259
Show them the masculinity
you are not showing me,...

693
01:05:49,427 --> 01:05:52,260
...so that we can get back
what this family has lost.

694
01:05:56,347 --> 01:05:58,144
Don't make me.

695
01:05:59,187 --> 01:06:00,905
l know, you will love it.

696
01:06:01,067 --> 01:06:03,945
You saw nothing but this
while growing up.

697
01:06:04,107 --> 01:06:07,417
But don't force me to do it.
No more of this.

698
01:06:09,987 --> 01:06:11,579
No more of this!

699
01:06:14,067 --> 01:06:15,216
Sir, your phone...

700
01:06:20,987 --> 01:06:22,943
''Alpago: l Found Her''

701
01:07:10,867 --> 01:07:14,826
Yagmur, there's someone here,
asking for you.

702
01:07:52,627 --> 01:07:54,185
Why didn't you listen to me?

703
01:07:57,587 --> 01:07:59,737
l've been looking for you
formonths.

704
01:08:03,667 --> 01:08:06,101
Zeynep, don't leave, you can stay.

705
01:08:11,747 --> 01:08:16,104
There was nothing to listen to.
You were going t get married.

706
01:08:16,547 --> 01:08:19,015
What should l have done,
become your mistress?

707
01:08:22,307 --> 01:08:23,945
l don't know why you are here.

708
01:08:25,707 --> 01:08:26,935
But you'd bettergo.

709
01:08:30,827 --> 01:08:32,818
My husband will retum soon.

710
01:08:56,307 --> 01:09:00,380
Yagmur?. Yagmur!
Okay, calm down.

711
01:09:26,867 --> 01:09:28,539
How's it going?

712
01:09:30,987 --> 01:09:32,386
l can't talk right now.

713
01:09:32,507 --> 01:09:35,305
l see, you still haven't finished it.
Don't let me disturb you.

714
01:09:35,427 --> 01:09:37,497
Don't forget about
the engagement rehearsal tomorrow.

715
01:09:37,667 --> 01:09:40,306
Alright.
l'll call you.

716
01:09:44,307 --> 01:09:47,265
''Hasmet was watching
the lives of the people...

717
01:09:47,427 --> 01:09:49,702
...that were built
on his unhappiness.

718
01:09:49,827 --> 01:09:54,423
He stopped questioning.
He just watched.''

719
01:09:59,587 --> 01:10:03,626
Brother, come on. These monsters
finished all the meat.

720
01:10:03,747 --> 01:10:05,100
Come on, come here.

721
01:10:05,227 --> 01:10:07,263
Alpago.
-Yes, sir?

722
01:10:11,787 --> 01:10:12,776
Wow, brother...

723
01:10:12,947 --> 01:10:16,496
Can you believe that Turhan
has a child, and we got to see it?

724
01:10:16,627 --> 01:10:18,982
How time flies, doesn't it?

725
01:10:19,867 --> 01:10:22,427
lt would have been nice
to see your kid...

726
01:10:28,507 --> 01:10:30,862
-What happened to youreye?
-My eye?

727
01:10:32,987 --> 01:10:34,625
ls it Hamza?

728
01:10:35,267 --> 01:10:37,064
Oh, brother...

729
01:10:43,267 --> 01:10:47,101
Where's Nupe?
Why isn't she coming down?

730
01:10:48,067 --> 01:10:49,819
She has the flu,
she's not coming down...

731
01:10:49,987 --> 01:10:51,818
...because she doesn't want to
infect the children.

732
01:11:21,467 --> 01:11:25,255
They are bringing their children here
on purpose.

733
01:11:25,427 --> 01:11:28,146
Trying to send me a message.

734
01:11:29,227 --> 01:11:32,264
l'm suffering more than you are.

735
01:11:35,627 --> 01:11:38,937
Some nights,
you kiss me in a way that...

736
01:11:39,107 --> 01:11:42,224
l know it's not me on your mind
at that moment.

737
01:11:42,907 --> 01:11:44,863
You kiss that bimbo.
-Nupe...

738
01:11:45,027 --> 01:11:49,384
Look, Hasmet, l will let you
think about hertonight.

739
01:11:49,547 --> 01:11:53,381
Come on, let's do it.
You don't love me, l know.

740
01:11:53,507 --> 01:11:58,535
Think of the woman that you do love.
Let me give you a child, please.

741
01:11:58,747 --> 01:12:00,226
Please?

742
01:12:01,067 --> 01:12:03,900
Don't run away!
What is this obsession you have?

743
01:12:04,067 --> 01:12:06,137
Why can't you save yourself?

744
01:12:10,227 --> 01:12:11,740
Give it to me.

745
01:12:13,707 --> 01:12:15,663
Nupe, give it to me.

746
01:12:28,667 --> 01:12:31,261
''She could not reach
the man she loved.

747
01:12:31,467 --> 01:12:34,743
The walls that needed to be taken
down were too tiring for Nupelda.

748
01:12:36,627 --> 01:12:39,983
As Hasmet tried to live the life
that was imposed on him,...

749
01:12:40,147 --> 01:12:42,263
...he could not escape his fate.

750
01:12:42,907 --> 01:12:48,220
Aword, a sound, or a song would
take him back to her. Every time...''

751
01:13:47,427 --> 01:13:49,224
''Pain...

752
01:13:50,107 --> 01:13:55,818
He felt the pain down to his
bones. The fire would not go out.

753
01:13:55,987 --> 01:14:01,380
Time is medicine, but
could it extinguishing this flame?''

754
01:14:02,107 --> 01:14:06,225
Run, get overhere.
Come here, come here.

755
01:14:06,427 --> 01:14:09,897
Look, why am l here, do you know?
l'm going to lstanbul.

756
01:14:10,067 --> 01:14:12,262
l will participate in a conference
forthree days.

757
01:14:12,427 --> 01:14:16,466
l would like for you to come too.
-No, l can't leave my father.

758
01:14:18,427 --> 01:14:21,783
Uncle Huseyin, would you like me to
take you to lstanbul?

759
01:14:21,947 --> 01:14:23,096
Yes! Yes! Yes!

760
01:14:23,227 --> 01:14:25,536
-What are you doing?
-l'm asking yourfather.

761
01:14:25,707 --> 01:14:28,938
You guys go, lstanbul
may prove to be too much forme.

762
01:14:29,067 --> 01:14:31,262
-Mom, please.
-Say ''yes''.

763
01:14:31,427 --> 01:14:33,941
You guys should go for a few days
and let me enjoy my privacy.

764
01:14:34,147 --> 01:14:36,058
Please, mom, please.

765
01:14:36,627 --> 01:14:40,381
Okay, okay. You think
l'm going to break yourheart?

766
01:14:44,067 --> 01:14:45,022
High five.

767
01:15:21,747 --> 01:15:23,817
Come on, hurry.

768
01:15:56,627 --> 01:15:59,300
Kemal, stop it.
Be nice.

769
01:15:59,467 --> 01:16:01,059
Give me yourhand.

770
01:16:03,907 --> 01:16:06,375
When you get back,
l will have a surprise for you.

771
01:16:40,147 --> 01:16:43,139
Stop, l want to play.

772
01:16:45,667 --> 01:16:47,578
Here you go.

773
01:16:55,307 --> 01:16:56,660
Stop.

774
01:16:57,267 --> 01:16:59,178
l'm sorry.

775
01:17:03,387 --> 01:17:05,139
Come on.

776
01:17:25,507 --> 01:17:27,657
You lied to me.
You are not married.

777
01:17:27,827 --> 01:17:30,625
Yourlast names are different.
You are staying in separate rooms.

778
01:17:30,827 --> 01:17:34,183
-How did you find us?
-l didn't find you, you found me.

779
01:17:37,307 --> 01:17:40,219
Yagmur, is that my son?

780
01:17:40,427 --> 01:17:43,658
Kemal, please let me go.
We will leave, l promise.

781
01:17:43,787 --> 01:17:46,824
Yagmur, is that ourson?

782
01:17:46,987 --> 01:17:49,706
Don't make me suffer any more,
please.

783
01:17:49,867 --> 01:17:52,301
For years now,
l'm living like l've died.

784
01:17:52,427 --> 01:17:54,861
Please don't disappear again.

785
01:17:57,187 --> 01:17:59,906
Go to your room and wait forme.
Be alone.

786
01:18:00,067 --> 01:18:03,423
Wait for me in yourroom, please.
-Kemal, let me go.

787
01:18:03,587 --> 01:18:04,815
l'll find you.

788
01:18:04,947 --> 01:18:07,302
l'll find you, Yagmur,
don't run from me.

789
01:18:07,467 --> 01:18:11,301
l beg of you,
go to yourroom and wait for me.

790
01:18:13,147 --> 01:18:16,423
You can stay down here,
l'lljoin you shortly.

791
01:18:16,587 --> 01:18:20,421
No, l'm fine, l'm fine.
l just need a little time alone.

792
01:18:24,067 --> 01:18:26,137
Okay, talk to you later, Sinan.

793
01:18:43,587 --> 01:18:47,375
Every breath l took after you,
was not like breathing.

794
01:18:48,547 --> 01:18:51,857
l lost all of my soul along with you.

795
01:18:55,827 --> 01:18:59,740
l've never loved any otherwoman
but you, Yagmur.

796
01:19:10,547 --> 01:19:12,742
ls he ourson?

797
01:19:14,947 --> 01:19:16,221
Yes.

798
01:19:27,627 --> 01:19:29,424
Why didn't you tell me?

799
01:19:30,147 --> 01:19:33,583
Why have you dragged me
through hell for all these years?

800
01:19:34,227 --> 01:19:36,138
They told me not to say anything.

801
01:19:36,307 --> 01:19:40,585
-Who?
-Hamza and yourbrother.

802
01:19:41,547 --> 01:19:44,744
They tried to get me
to have an abortion.

803
01:19:44,907 --> 01:19:48,138
Hamza said ''have this child,
and we are all going to die''.

804
01:19:48,307 --> 01:19:52,061
They said they would kill you
if l didn't stay away.

805
01:19:52,227 --> 01:19:55,663
l was afraid of
something happening to you.

806
01:19:56,987 --> 01:20:00,218
All of them
will have to answerto me.

807
01:20:00,387 --> 01:20:04,858
lt wasn't easy to raise him.
l always lived on the edge.

808
01:20:06,427 --> 01:20:09,897
Afraid that somebody would try to
take my child away from me.

809
01:20:10,067 --> 01:20:11,466
l want forhim...

810
01:20:11,587 --> 01:20:13,817
...to have a different kind of world
than the world you have.

811
01:20:14,027 --> 01:20:15,380
Please, let us go.

812
01:20:20,307 --> 01:20:24,346
That's not possible.
lt's no longer possible.

813
01:20:25,427 --> 01:20:27,987
Mom, where are you?

814
01:20:32,307 --> 01:20:35,583
Mom, can we go to the pool
with Uncle Sinan?

815
01:21:05,507 --> 01:21:09,056
-ls yourname Kemal?
-Yes.

816
01:21:11,027 --> 01:21:14,542
My name is Kemal too.
Nice to meet you.

817
01:21:16,027 --> 01:21:18,097
Kemal, come on,
are we ready for a swim...

818
01:21:21,987 --> 01:21:23,864
Mr. Sinan, our doctor.

819
01:21:24,067 --> 01:21:27,423
We came to lstanbul with him,
he had a conference.

820
01:21:27,587 --> 01:21:29,100
Mr. Kemal is...

821
01:21:30,867 --> 01:21:32,266
...a friend of the family.

822
01:21:33,187 --> 01:21:35,337
-Nice to meet you.
-Likewise.

823
01:21:38,227 --> 01:21:40,821
-Do you like lstanbul?
-Yes, l liked it a lot.

824
01:21:40,987 --> 01:21:43,945
You know, l'm staying
at a hotel forthe first time.

825
01:21:44,107 --> 01:21:45,586
lt has a huge pool.

826
01:21:45,707 --> 01:21:49,746
Mom, can we go?
-Of course, my love.

827
01:22:01,147 --> 01:22:03,456
lt was nice to meet you.

828
01:22:23,947 --> 01:22:25,346
Nice to meet you too.

829
01:22:30,347 --> 01:22:33,623
Kemal, come on,
let's go down to the pool.

830
01:22:52,987 --> 01:22:54,898
You did a great job raising him.

831
01:22:56,907 --> 01:22:59,137
Without him, l couldn't have
gone on with anything.

832
01:22:59,307 --> 01:23:03,539
Every day without you was like hell.
His presence has lessened my pain.

833
01:23:03,707 --> 01:23:07,666
l promise you, from now on,
it's you, me, and ourson.

834
01:23:07,867 --> 01:23:09,585
l don't care about the rest.

835
01:23:10,467 --> 01:23:15,541
-But you are married...
-You two are my family.

836
01:23:15,707 --> 01:23:21,225
Please don't disappear again.
Give me a chance to fix everything.

837
01:23:21,387 --> 01:23:23,503
You grew within me from day to day.

838
01:23:24,187 --> 01:23:27,179
So, this was the reason.
l felt it.

839
01:23:36,947 --> 01:23:38,744
You haven't forgotten me.

840
01:23:41,667 --> 01:23:43,498
ls it possible to forget you?

841
01:23:44,347 --> 01:23:47,464
We have a son who has youreyes.

842
01:24:31,627 --> 01:24:35,905
Today, l will send you to a place.
No one knows it but me.

843
01:24:36,107 --> 01:24:39,258
l will take care of everything, and
a few days later, l willjoin you.

844
01:24:39,387 --> 01:24:41,617
l don't want you to
endanger yourself, Kemal.

845
01:24:41,827 --> 01:24:43,738
He has grown accustomed
to being fatherless.

846
01:24:43,907 --> 01:24:48,298
Please don't take this away from me.
l have a right to it.

847
01:24:50,147 --> 01:24:52,217
l grew up without a father.

848
01:24:52,427 --> 01:24:55,499
Give me a chance to raise him
the way l was neverraised.

849
01:24:55,627 --> 01:24:56,980
Please.

850
01:25:08,867 --> 01:25:11,939
What's up, you've called 50 times
since this moming.

851
01:25:12,067 --> 01:25:13,022
l hope there's nothing wrong.

852
01:25:13,187 --> 01:25:15,223
l'm at the hotel.
Be here in an hour.

853
01:25:48,387 --> 01:25:49,820
Mom, l'm sleepy.

854
01:25:50,027 --> 01:25:52,495
Alright, my love,
you can sleep on the way now.

855
01:26:06,387 --> 01:26:08,378
Come here, you, come here!

856
01:26:08,987 --> 01:26:11,979
What did you do?
-What are you saying?

857
01:26:12,187 --> 01:26:14,655
You moron!
Didn't you say she had a miscarriage?

858
01:26:14,827 --> 01:26:18,058
Wasn't she supposed to
nevertum up again?

859
01:26:18,187 --> 01:26:19,256
That's what she told me.

860
01:26:19,427 --> 01:26:22,544
-Should l kill you now, God damn...
-Hamza!

861
01:26:24,027 --> 01:26:29,055
Have you gotten big enough to be able
to come to our home and harass us?

862
01:26:29,227 --> 01:26:30,626
Yourson bumed us.

863
01:26:30,787 --> 01:26:35,303
Yourstep-son is digging the graves
for both Turhan and himself.

864
01:26:36,267 --> 01:26:37,985
Mom, the girl said
''l will stay away from your brother''.

865
01:26:38,147 --> 01:26:40,866
She's there!
She gave birth to the kid.

866
01:26:41,027 --> 01:26:42,619
l saw them with my own eyes!

867
01:26:42,827 --> 01:26:45,182
Do you realize what sort of a fire
you have cast us all into?

868
01:26:45,347 --> 01:26:46,826
He will take woman and the kid
and disappear.

869
01:26:46,947 --> 01:26:48,858
Lady Fadile, whateverhappens
afterthat, will happen to us!

870
01:26:58,467 --> 01:27:00,503
l give up.

871
01:27:08,627 --> 01:27:09,662
Hamza?

872
01:27:09,827 --> 01:27:11,055
Get yourthings packed.

873
01:27:12,067 --> 01:27:13,022
l don't understand.

874
01:27:13,187 --> 01:27:14,461
l'll pick you up in an hour.

875
01:27:14,627 --> 01:27:16,140
Transferall the bank accounts
within an hour.

876
01:27:16,307 --> 01:27:18,104
Come to where l tell you to come
when l call.

877
01:27:18,307 --> 01:27:20,059
Are we really going finally?

878
01:27:20,267 --> 01:27:22,906
We are going halfway around the
world, away from all this crap.

879
01:27:23,107 --> 01:27:24,301
l'll call you.

880
01:27:35,747 --> 01:27:37,066
What are you doing here?

881
01:27:40,187 --> 01:27:41,939
Hamza, where are you going?

882
01:27:42,107 --> 01:27:43,665
l'm not the dog of this house
Hamza.

883
01:27:43,827 --> 01:27:46,625
l'm yourwife!
l said, ''where are you going''!

884
01:27:46,787 --> 01:27:49,062
You haven't been around
forseveral days already.

885
01:27:50,467 --> 01:27:52,697
You are running away with that
bankerwoman, aren't you?

886
01:27:52,907 --> 01:27:54,420
Get off my back!

887
01:28:23,947 --> 01:28:25,141
Call the hospital!

888
01:28:33,347 --> 01:28:35,986
She has a broken neck
and is in serious condition.

889
01:28:36,187 --> 01:28:41,386
We are trying to keep her alive,
but herlife will neverbe the same.

890
01:28:51,467 --> 01:28:55,585
l had to do it,
or l would have lost all of you.

891
01:28:55,827 --> 01:28:59,866
You spared yourown son,
but tried to kill mine.

892
01:29:02,307 --> 01:29:04,423
-Brother!
-Turhan.

893
01:29:04,587 --> 01:29:06,100
-Brother, forgive me!
-Shut up, boy.

894
01:29:06,267 --> 01:29:07,222
Brother!

895
01:29:10,107 --> 01:29:13,144
So, l'm the guilty one, huh?

896
01:29:13,987 --> 01:29:15,306
There are thousands of men...

897
01:29:15,507 --> 01:29:17,941
...who are eaming theirbread money
due to this marriage.

898
01:29:18,107 --> 01:29:23,659
Now these people will cry out
forblood. Starting with Sitki!

899
01:29:30,947 --> 01:29:32,938
l didn't shoot Mr. lhsan.

900
01:29:34,747 --> 01:29:36,738
l'm not going down for it.

901
01:29:36,907 --> 01:29:39,216
You didn't come with me,
you weren't there.

902
01:29:39,427 --> 01:29:42,499
You don't know what happened.
-l told you not to go!

903
01:29:47,187 --> 01:29:50,623
Whatever happened, happened, Hasmet.
We grew up like brothers, you and l.

904
01:29:50,747 --> 01:29:56,424
l've always tried to protect you, but
you know this world as well as l do.

905
01:29:56,587 --> 01:30:00,296
They will not forget about blood.
There is no escape from this.

906
01:30:00,467 --> 01:30:03,664
lf you hadn't shot that man,
l'd already be long gone!

907
01:30:07,347 --> 01:30:10,180
l stayed to protect you.

908
01:30:16,507 --> 01:30:18,259
The bank called.

909
01:30:20,507 --> 01:30:22,816
You tried to empty youraccounts.

910
01:30:24,907 --> 01:30:29,981
You didn't go because
business was slow.

911
01:30:30,627 --> 01:30:33,266
You didn't have any money
to take with you.

912
01:30:33,987 --> 01:30:36,626
You were going to profit
from this marriage too.

913
01:30:36,747 --> 01:30:38,226
You waited.

914
01:30:41,307 --> 01:30:44,299
Hamza, you tried to kill my son.

915
01:30:46,827 --> 01:30:48,818
You left my sisterfor dead.

916
01:30:50,067 --> 01:30:53,946
You know that
you can't escape this.

917
01:31:14,707 --> 01:31:17,505
They won't let you live.

918
01:31:19,667 --> 01:31:21,020
l know.

919
01:32:17,627 --> 01:32:21,336
-l was very worried about you.
-Here l am.

920
01:32:30,827 --> 01:32:34,581
Look at what ourguys brought me
from the security room.

921
01:32:38,547 --> 01:32:40,185
Sitki, are you sure?

922
01:32:40,947 --> 01:32:42,175
ls it her?

923
01:32:42,587 --> 01:32:47,263
l'm sure, my sister, l'm sure.
l also looked at the hotel records.

924
01:32:47,427 --> 01:32:50,339
Her name is Yagmur.
This is the girl.

925
01:32:53,227 --> 01:32:54,785
Today is my day.

926
01:32:55,347 --> 01:32:58,976
Shall l use my voice now?
Do l have yourpermission?

927
01:33:32,547 --> 01:33:34,936
lt's like everything's fine,
like...

928
01:33:35,107 --> 01:33:38,861
...l've gone on vacation to a summer
house with you and our child.

929
01:33:39,587 --> 01:33:41,543
l wish that were true.

930
01:33:44,667 --> 01:33:47,340
l could neverlive my own life.

931
01:33:47,507 --> 01:33:50,340
For me, the realest moment
is this moment.

932
01:33:57,787 --> 01:34:00,665
Alpago.
-Yes, sir?

933
01:34:00,907 --> 01:34:03,546
-Prepare the barbecue.
-Sure.

934
01:34:51,747 --> 01:34:53,703
What will happen now?

935
01:34:55,387 --> 01:34:56,945
l have to go.

936
01:34:57,867 --> 01:35:00,256
You will wait for me here.

937
01:35:00,427 --> 01:35:02,497
lf l don't come back
until tomorrow night,...

938
01:35:02,667 --> 01:35:04,737
...the guys will take you from here.

939
01:35:07,547 --> 01:35:09,105
Don't go.

940
01:35:09,747 --> 01:35:11,942
We can go
to another part of the world.

941
01:35:12,107 --> 01:35:14,143
Aplace they can't find us...

942
01:35:14,867 --> 01:35:17,097
We can establish new lives.

943
01:35:17,787 --> 01:35:21,097
Please, Kemal,
l can't bearto lose you again.

944
01:35:22,067 --> 01:35:23,819
Please.

945
01:35:25,227 --> 01:35:26,421
Sir.

946
01:35:32,427 --> 01:35:37,626
God loves the patient ones.
Of course, my heart is good.

947
01:35:37,787 --> 01:35:40,824
That day will come, l said
to myself, l've been patient.

948
01:35:40,987 --> 01:35:43,660
God has granted me
a part of my prayers, Hasmet.

949
01:35:43,827 --> 01:35:46,500
Look, if you noticed,
l said ''part of my prayers''.

950
01:35:46,667 --> 01:35:51,104
Because l have Turhan at gunpoint.

951
01:35:51,267 --> 01:35:54,145
lf it were you instead,
then it would be complete.

952
01:35:56,307 --> 01:35:58,184
-Alpago, get the car.
-Of course.

953
01:35:58,347 --> 01:36:01,657
Kemal, l beg of you, don't go.
Please, please.

954
01:36:01,827 --> 01:36:03,146
l have to go.

955
01:36:03,307 --> 01:36:05,343
lf you want me to
come back to you as Kemal,...

956
01:36:05,467 --> 01:36:07,583
...l have to leave Hasmet with them.

957
01:36:08,667 --> 01:36:11,261
You are the only woman
l've everloved.

958
01:36:12,267 --> 01:36:14,542
Don't you everforget that.

959
01:37:11,627 --> 01:37:13,538
Don't go.

960
01:37:58,867 --> 01:38:02,860
-Alpago, take Turhan away.
-No.

961
01:38:08,427 --> 01:38:10,179
Keep your anger inside.

962
01:38:13,027 --> 01:38:17,259
Don't do anything crazy.
Alpago, there is no end to this.

963
01:38:17,427 --> 01:38:19,782
Come on, take Turhan
and get out of here.

964
01:38:20,987 --> 01:38:25,538
-Allow me, let me kill them all.
-Come on, come on.

965
01:38:25,707 --> 01:38:27,777
There is no end to it.
Come on, champ.

966
01:38:27,947 --> 01:38:30,381
Take Turhan and get out of here,
come on.

967
01:38:33,307 --> 01:38:34,899
Let them go.

968
01:38:47,507 --> 01:38:49,179
Let us speak alone.

969
01:38:50,947 --> 01:38:53,905
-Sitki, leave us alone.
-Sister!

970
01:38:54,067 --> 01:38:56,103
Sitki, get out!

971
01:39:10,187 --> 01:39:12,655
lt didn't have to be this way.

972
01:39:14,147 --> 01:39:16,615
l'd have given anything for you.

973
01:39:18,147 --> 01:39:20,377
l tried so hard.

974
01:39:21,427 --> 01:39:24,737
But you broke the agreement
between us, Hasmet.

975
01:39:24,907 --> 01:39:26,704
You made a toy out of my dignity.

976
01:39:26,867 --> 01:39:29,540
You played
with my sense of femininity.

977
01:39:30,227 --> 01:39:32,661
You humiliated me
towards my family.

978
01:39:34,507 --> 01:39:36,577
l have a son with her.

979
01:39:39,787 --> 01:39:41,664
He is a part of me.

980
01:39:45,707 --> 01:39:47,186
Alright.

981
01:39:48,587 --> 01:39:50,066
l accept.

982
01:39:50,987 --> 01:39:52,340
Bring the child,...

983
01:39:54,227 --> 01:39:56,741
...but leave that bimbo
out of our lives.

984
01:40:04,147 --> 01:40:06,024
Set out a new life for yourself.

985
01:40:07,347 --> 01:40:10,862
l have worked very hard
to cool this fire.

986
01:40:11,027 --> 01:40:13,461
Like you, l have sacrificed myself.

987
01:40:15,147 --> 01:40:18,776
But it didn't work,
the flames didn't die out.

988
01:40:21,467 --> 01:40:22,866
Don't go.

989
01:40:24,147 --> 01:40:26,058
For God's sake, don't go.

990
01:40:28,267 --> 01:40:31,418
lf you stay with me,
l'll protect you.

991
01:40:31,587 --> 01:40:34,738
No one can hurt you
while you're by my side.

992
01:40:38,267 --> 01:40:40,906
lf l leave here,
they will shoot me, right?

993
01:40:41,987 --> 01:40:43,261
Yes.

994
01:40:48,987 --> 01:40:51,376
Well, if l die,
does that stop the bloodshed?

995
01:40:58,107 --> 01:40:59,620
Don't do it, Hasmet.

996
01:40:59,747 --> 01:41:02,181
Nupelda, if l die,
will this warstop?

997
01:41:02,347 --> 01:41:05,862
-Put down the gun.
-Nupe, will the blood feud stop?

998
01:41:18,347 --> 01:41:19,666
Sister!

999
01:41:20,867 --> 01:41:22,425
No more talking, shoot him!

1000
01:41:22,587 --> 01:41:24,817
That is ourfather's killer,
standing in front of you!

1001
01:41:24,987 --> 01:41:28,457
lf you don't shoot, l'm going to!
-l said ''leave us alone'', Sitki!

1002
01:41:28,627 --> 01:41:32,176
He's trying to deceive you!
He's trying to trick you!

1003
01:41:32,347 --> 01:41:36,465
l will not be able to rest
until l have bled this bastard out!

1004
01:41:37,027 --> 01:41:38,904
l beg you, stay with me.

1005
01:41:40,387 --> 01:41:41,979
l beg you.

1006
01:41:43,187 --> 01:41:45,655
Come on, sister, shoot!

1007
01:43:33,467 --> 01:43:35,856
l neverknew that this pain
would cause you to stray...

1008
01:43:36,027 --> 01:43:38,143
...and rob me of my heart.

1009
01:45:08,667 --> 01:45:10,419
ls this the ring?

1010
01:45:11,827 --> 01:45:13,340
Yes.

1011
01:45:55,387 --> 01:46:00,063
l neverknew that this pain,

1012
01:46:00,227 --> 01:46:08,225
Would cause you to stray,
And rob me of my heart.

1013
01:46:10,747 --> 01:46:18,745
l never knew that l had
Rains and blood inside.

1014
01:46:26,187 --> 01:46:30,738
l never knew that
What l had the most,

1015
01:46:30,907 --> 01:46:36,857
Would have to settle for
What l don't have.

1016
01:46:38,147 --> 01:46:43,267
That the farthest
Would become the closest,

1017
01:46:43,427 --> 01:46:51,425
And that the closest
Would then be lost to me.

1018
01:46:53,387 --> 01:47:01,385
l never knew.
l never knew.

1019
01:47:05,667 --> 01:47:13,665
l never knew.
l never knew.

1020
01:47:18,547 --> 01:47:21,300
Are you mad at me,
My one and only?

1021
01:47:21,467 --> 01:47:24,743
lf you are, it's been too long,
Just so you know.

1022
01:47:24,907 --> 01:47:27,944
Bumt-scented
winds hit my face.

1023
01:47:28,107 --> 01:47:30,337
My shivering is
Keeping me from breathing.

1024
01:47:30,507 --> 01:47:33,260
Hesitant words are
Stuck in my throat.

1025
01:47:33,427 --> 01:47:36,499
They took the nearest right tum
And parked themselves.

1026
01:47:36,667 --> 01:47:41,104
They were disobedient words.
They say loving is a secret by name.

1027
01:47:41,307 --> 01:47:44,344
Noisy letters are
becoming silent.

1028
01:47:44,507 --> 01:47:47,465
They are leaving Their
most intimate feelings behind.

1029
01:47:47,627 --> 01:47:50,460
Are you not tired of my voice,
My silent scream?

1030
01:47:50,627 --> 01:47:54,461
Your place is within my mess.
Let's tum it into a dream.
